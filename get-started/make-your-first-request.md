**Prerequisites**: For the following, you'll need a Mindee account. You can learn how to create an account and subscribe to an API [in the Setup your account section](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/setup-your-account).

# Create an API Key

Once you are logged in, you'll land on the APIs hub where you can see your APIs and the APIs Store.

# The Live Interface

This is your home for no code testing where you see your file in our graphical interface. You can quickly visualize all the extracted fields along with the raw API JSON response. There are two ways to use this:

1. Use ** Use my camera** located at the bottom of the screen to take a picture of your documents.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "Allow your browser to use your camera. Otherwise, you won't be able to take a picture."
}
[/block]
2. Click on **New document** to upload your files. You may upload several files, which will appear below. Select them to get your extracted fields, as shown below.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/57bb01f-liveInterface.png",
        "liveInterface.png",
        1000,
        567,
        "#dbd8d3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Once your document is shown on the live interface, it automatically extracts fields and highlights them, allowing you to examine them using **Expected fields** and **API response**. 


[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8ce50ae-Screenshot_2021-12-03_at_17.20.56.png",
        "Screenshot 2021-12-03 at 17.20.56.png",
        1818,
        1364,
        "#b3b1aa"
      ],
      "caption": "Expected fields"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The API response gives a raw JSON of the extracted fields.
