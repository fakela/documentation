This guide will walk you through the fundamental processes of making API calls and queries using our document parsing APIs.

## Prerequisites
For the following, you'll need a Mindee account. For more information on how to create an account and subscribe to an API see [Setup your account section](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/setup-your-account).

# Create an API Key
Once you are logged in, you'll land on the APIs hub where you can see your APIs and the off-the-shelf APIs at the APIs Store.

# The Live Interface
This is your home for no code testing. In our graphical user interface, you can view the file you've uploaded. You can also see all of the extracted information, as well as the raw API JSON response, in one location. To make use of this feature

![Live interface](https://files.readme.io/2e3e774-Screenshot_2022-01-08_at_01.02.01.png "live interface")


1. On the left side of the screen, Click on  click on **Live interface** 

2. Select either **Use my camera** or **New document** located at the bottom of the screen upload your documents to Mindee. 

The **use my camera** feature takes a picture of your documents. You'll need to allow your browser to use your camera. Otherwise, you won't be able to take a picture. Using the **New document** feature you may upload several files, which will appear below. 

3. Select the files uploaded below to view the extracted fields. Once your document is shown on the live interface, it automatically extracts fields from the document and highlights them. 


#### Expected fields
You can examine the extracted fields using **Expected fields** column.
